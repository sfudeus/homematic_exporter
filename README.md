# homematic_exporter

A simple tool to export data from [Homematic](https://www.homematic.com/) devices for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), written in Python 3.

`homematic_exporter` will listen on a freely definable port and emit data in prometheus format which is periodically fetched via XML-RPC from CCU3. The fetching period is configurable, too.

`homematic_exporter` was originally written for HomematicIP, but was verified to work with the BidCoS-RF devices as well (specifically HM-CC-RT-DN and HM-WDS40-TH-I-2, thanks to @NilsGriebner), just the respective port needs to be used (`2010` for HomematicIP and `2001` for BidCoS-RF)

## Usage

The exporter can be run in different modes:

* with `--dump_devices`, only the device list will be dumped and the script terminates (used for debugging purposes)
* with `--dump_parameters <deviceAddress>`, the parameters of a single device are dumped and the script terminates (used for debugging purposes)
* with `--dump_device_mappings`, all devices recognized from the CCU are dumped
* without special arguments (only `ccu_host` is mandatory) data is continuously gathered and exposed via HTTP on the port defined by `--port <port>`

```bash

usage: exporter.py [-h] --ccu_host CCU_HOST [--ccu_port CCU_PORT] [--ccu_user CCU_USER] [--ccu_pass CCU_PASS] [--interval INTERVAL]
                   [--mappingreload MAPPINGRELOAD] [--port PORT] [--config_file CONFIG_FILE] [--debug] [--dump_devices] [--dump_parameters DUMP_PARAMETERS]
                   [--dump_device_mappings]
optional arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --ccu_host CCU_HOST    The hostname of the ccu instance
  --ccu_port CCU_PORT    The port for the xmlrpc service (2001 for BidcosRF, 2010 for HmIP)
  --ccu_user CCU_USER    The username for the CCU (if authentication is enabled)
  --ccu_pass CCU_PASS    The password for the CCU (if authentication is enabled)
  --interval INTERVAL    The interval between two gathering runs in seconds
  --mappingreload MAPPINGRELOAD
                         After how many intervals the device mappings are reloaded
  --port PORT            The port where to expose the exporter
  --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                         A config file with e.g. supported types and device mappings
  --debug
  --dump_devices         Do not start exporter, just dump device list
  --dump_parameters DUMP_PARAMETERS
                         Do not start exporter, just dump device parameters of given device
  --dump_device_mappings Do not start exporter, just dump device mappings
```

Can be used via docker as well.

```bash

> $ docker run --rm sfudeus/homematic_exporter --help
usage: homematic_exporter [-h] --ccu_host CCU_HOST [--ccu_port CCU_PORT] [--ccu_user CCU_USER] [--ccu_pass CCU_PASS] [--interval INTERVAL]

                          [--dump_parameters DUMP_PARAMETERS] [--dump_device_mappings]

options:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --ccu_host CCU_HOST    The hostname of the ccu instance
  --ccu_port CCU_PORT    The port for the xmlrpc service (2001 for BidcosRF, 2010 for HmIP)

  --ccu_pass CCU_PASS    The password for the CCU (if authentication is enabled)
  --interval INTERVAL    The interval between two gathering runs in seconds
  --mappingreload MAPPINGRELOAD
                         After how many intervals the device mappings are reloaded
  --port PORT            The port where to expose the exporter
  --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                         A config file with e.g. supported types and device mappings
  --debug
  --dump_devices         Do not start exporter, just dump device list
  --dump_parameters DUMP_PARAMETERS
                         Do not start exporter, just dump device parameters of given device
  --dump_device_mappings Do not start exporter, just dump device mappings
```

## Metrics

Metrics are all prefixed with `homematic_`, the remaining name is based on the parameter name within the device descriptor.
All metrics are equipped with labels for the `ccu` instance, the device address, device type and parent device type.
In addition a device mapping can be added via `--config_file`. Device addresses can be mapped to custom device ids, names,
rooms, and functions which are then usable as labels in e.g. Grafana.
If no mappings are in the config file, the names from the CCU user interface are used and exposed as labels `device_id`,
`device_name`, `device_room`, and `device_function`.

## CCU configuration

The CCU needs to be configured to be able to fetch data.

* For the general functionality, the XML-RPC interface (port 2001, 2010) must be accessible\
(`Settings -> Control panel -> Configure firewall -> XML-RPC API`)
* For retrieving device mappings from the CCU, the Script API (port 8181) has to be enabled\
(`Settings -> Control panel -> Configure firewall -> Script API`)\
By providing a device mapping configuration, no access to the Script API is required.

`Restricted access` is sufficient if the exporter is running on a host whitelisted for restricted access\
`(Settings -> Control panel -> Configure firewall -> IP addresses for restricted access)`.\
Otherwise you'd need `Full access`.

It is highly advisable to enable authentication\
(`Settings -> Control panel -> Security -> Authentication`).
Credentials are provided via `--ccu_user` and `--ccu_pass`.

## Restrictions

Only a configurable list of device types is supported so far (since I could only test those). Currently these are:

* the weather station (`HmIP-SWO-PL`)
* the temperature and humidity sensor (with and without display) (`HmIP-STH`, `HmIP-STHD`)
* the pluggable switch/meter (`HMIP-PSM`)
* the flush-mount switch/meter (`HmIP-FSM`)
* the water sensor (`HmIP-SWD`)
* window and door contact (`HMIP-SWDO`), thanks to @kremers
* BidCoS-RF radiator thermostat (`HM-CC-RT-DN`), thanks to @NilsGriebner
* BidCoS-RF temperature and humidity sensor (`HM-WDS40-TH-I-2`), thanks to @NilsGriebner

See the list `DEFAULT_SUPPORTED_TYPES` in `exporter.py` for the default list, which has been used at least once successfully by a user.

If you want support for more devices, you can easily extend them via config file or wait for me to implement that. You can support that by [donating](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/342DL52U9EX2U?ref_=wl_share) the intended device :-).
Feel free to open issues for unsupported items.

## Build

For multi-architecture builds (x86, arm, arm64), e.g. use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64 -t sfudeus/homematic_exporter:latest .` or use `build.sh`.

You can usually find an up-to-date image for amd64, arm and arm64 at sfudeus/homematic_exporter:latest in [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sfudeus/homematic_exporter). Additionally, they are tagged with their build date to have a stable reference.
